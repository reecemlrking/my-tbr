# my-tbr
my-tbr is an app/website for keeping track of all those books you've been meaning to read. It allows you to add books to your tbr by searching them within the app/web or scanning the book's ISBN barcode with your phone. It also allows you to sort your books into various lists including Read and Owned as well as libraries you determine.
